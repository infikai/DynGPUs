# This script launches a training process on the GPU, switches it to the CPU,
# and then uses CRIU to time the dump and restore operations.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
# 1. Horovod is installed.
# 2. CRIU is installed and configured (requires sudo/root).
# 3. The Python script 'dynamic_train.py' is in this directory.
